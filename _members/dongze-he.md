I am a Ph.D. candidate in Neural Engineering at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu), working at [Neuroimaging Lab](https://www.neuroimaginglabpitt.org). After receiving my B.S. degree in Physics from [Nazarbayev University](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=nazarbayev+university&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) in Kazakhstan, I obtained my M.S. degree in Bioengineering from the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu) where I joined [Biophotonics and Imaging Laboratory](https://depts.washington.edu/wangast/index.html). Our projects focused on developing novel and clinically useful biomedical imaging techniques for early diagnosis, treatment and management of human diseases. The goal of my current Ph.D. work is to understand the interplay between neural network, inhibitory neurons in particular, and cerebrovascular system in health and disease, and whether this understanding could be utilized in developing new therapies for treating brain disorders such as vascular dementia and Alzheimerâ€™s disease.
